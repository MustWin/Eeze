  Eeze is the logical conclusion of an older github project of mine, github.com/cousinwil/St.eeze. Eeze takes what I was trying to do by offering some base styles and moving them into LESS mix-ins and variables to make HTML5/CSS3 development a breeze.

  Unlike Twitter Bootstrap, Eeze comes as a minimal starting point for your app. Iâ€™ve only included the most common building blocks and base file structure that you might need to create a custom application. There are no base preset styles to work around, delete, or overwrite. Just clone the app and start writing *your* code in seconds.

  Files:
    images/

    stylesheets/

      less/

        app-modules/
          application.less - empty to start, 
          buttons.less - empty to start, 
          media-queries.less - sets up your media queries, pulls all the "responsive-" less files.
          responsive-full.less, responsive-mobile.less, responsive-tablet.less - width-specific stylesheets
          typography - empty to start, 
          variables - empty to start,
    
        eeze-modules/
          1140-grid.less, 960-grid.less - choose your popular grid or import your own. Defaults to http://cssgrid.net's 1140-grid (update stylesheets/less/eeze.less to change to your preference.)
          copyright.less - just a simple copyright stamper.
          css3.less - the basic css3 less mixins, when used they automatically add the browser specific styles to your CSS
          html5_doctor.less, normalize.less - use the html5 reset or normalize? Defaults to normalize.css
          reusables - 20 base styles that seem indespensible
    
        app.less - compiles the application less styles
        eeze.less - compiles your custom eeze.css file

      app.css - out of the box compiles CSS (doesn't look like much, it shouldn't until you write this part.)
      eeze.min.css - the standard eeze file has normalize, 1140 grid, and some base files  

    base.html - base elements of a modern front end HTML5 template
    

  Documentation is coming soon to http://eeze.us
