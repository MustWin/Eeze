#Eeze v0.6

##What  
Eeze is a clean slate for front end developers creating custom applications. Easy access to mix and match all your favorite open source libraries like bootstrap, font awesome, lesshat, etc.


##Why
Weâ€™ve included the most common building blocks and base file structure for a new application's view layer. There are no base preset styles to work around, delete, or overwrite. Just clone the app, choose your presets, and start writing *your* code in seconds.


##How
There are a few base files for you to work with... We use these to mix and match libraries we'd like to use to create our app. Want fontawesome icons, bootstrap grids, and lesshat mixins? No problem! By selecting the building blocks you want to use and commenting out the others you can quickly build the foundation of your app.

* `images/` - where you put your images
* `stylesheets/`
  * `less/`
    * `app-styles/`
      * `application.less` - empty to start - this is where *you* write all your base application styles.
      * `elements.less` - empty to start - this is where *you* add all your base element styles.
      * `media-queries.less` - sets up your media queries
      * `variables.less` - empty to start - this is where *you* define color variables, font variables, etc
    * `base-library/`
      * `bootstrap/` - bootstrap less files
      * `grids/` - grid system includes
      * `icons/` - icon font less files
      * `mixins/` - less mixins and reusables
      * `reset/` - css resets and normalize
    * `app.less` - compiles the styles you have declared into app.css
    * `base.less` - compiles your custom base.css file
    * `bootstrap.less` - compiles your own version of bootstrap.css
    * `fonts.less` - compiles your custom fonts.css file
  * `app.css` - out of the box compiled CSS (doesn't look like much, it shouldn't until you write this part.)
  * `base.css` - mix and match reusables, grids, normalize or reset, etc 
  * `fonts.css` - fontawesome, or whatever other icon fonts and custom web fonts you declare
* `base.html` - base elements of a modern front end HTML5 template, ready to go!
