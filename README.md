#Eeze v0.6

##What  
Eeze is a clean slate for front end developers creating custom applications. Easy access to mix and match all your favorite open source libraries like bootstrap, font awesome, lesshat, etc.

##Why
Weâ€™ve included the most common building blocks and base file structure for a new application's view layer. There are no base preset styles to work around, delete, or overwrite. Just clone the app, choose your presets, and start writing *your* code in seconds.

##How
There are a few base files for you to work with...

* `images/` - where you put your images
  * `stylesheets/`
  * `less/`
    * `app-styles/`
      * `application.less` - empty to start - this is where *you* write all your base application styles.
      * `elements.less` - empty to start - this is where *you* add all your base element styles.
      * `media-queries.less` - sets up your media queries
      * `variables.less` - empty to start - this is where *you* define color variables, font variables, etc
    * `base-library/`
      * `bootstrap/` - bootstrap less files
      * `grids/` - grid system includes
      * `icons/` - icon font less files
      * `mixins/` - less mixins and reusables
      * `reset/` - css resets and normalize
    * `app.less` - compiles the styles you have declared into app.css
    * `base.less` - compiles your custom base.css file
    * `bootstrap.less` - compiles your own version of bootstrap.css
    * `fonts.less` - compiles your custom fonts.css file
  * `app.css` - out of the box compiled CSS (doesn't look like much, it shouldn't until you write this part.)
  * `base.css` - mix and match reusables, grids, normalize or reset, etc 
  * `fonts.css` - fontawesome, or whatever other icon fonts and custom web fonts you declare
* `base.html` - base elements of a modern front end HTML5 template, ready to go!

##Writing a new app.css, fonts.css, or base.css

###app.css: 
  * Edit your styles in stylesheets/less/app.less
  * From the Eeze directory in your terminal run: 
  `lessc stylesheets/less/app.less > stylesheets/app.css`

###base.css:
  * Edit your styles in stylesheets/less/base.less
  * From the Eeze directory in your terminal run: 
  `lessc stylesheets/less/base.less > stylesheets/base.css`
